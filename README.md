## Introduction

The Quiz Platform is a web-based application designed to provide users with an engaging and interactive quiz-taking experience. It incorporates a variety of features, including user registration, quiz participation, score tracking, leaderboards, and more. The platform leverages cutting-edge technologies to ensure performance, security, and seamless integration with blockchain networks.

## Features

The Quiz Platform boasts an array of features that enhance both user and developer experiences:

- **User Registration and Login System:** Players can effortlessly register an account using their ENS name, allowing them to participate in quizzes. The registration process involves ENS domain registration and verification. A user-friendly login system is integrated, leveraging ENS for a secure login mechanism.

- **Database Management and Leaderboard Functionality:** Efficient storage and retrieval of quiz questions, answers, and user data are managed through a well-designed database schema. Users' quiz scores are tracked and displayed on visually appealing leaderboards.

- **Quiz Features:** Players can view their quiz scores as a percentage and on a gauge, providing a clear understanding of their performance. After submitting answers, users can access correct answer options for review. Detailed results of each quiz question are displayed, and questions are randomized for each attempt.

- **Cloudflare Worker Integration:** Cloudflare Workers are employed to enhance performance and reduce latency. Static assets are cached (CSS, JS, images), and dynamic content generation is achieved for specific pages. URL rewriting, redirection logic, rate limiting, security checks, and load balancing are also configured using Cloudflare Workers.

- **Admin Panel:** An intuitive admin panel allows administrators to manage quizzes, questions, and user data. This includes adding, editing, and deleting quiz questions, as well as user data management features.

- **Additional Features:** Users are provided with an outcome screen at the end of a quiz, displaying a summary of their performance. Integration with Arbitrum and Avalanche blockchains offers fast and secure interactions for users.
